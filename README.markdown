Pew Pew Ping!
=============
Major media outlets report a barrage of ICMP packets as a DDOS "attack," but the reality of a bunch of kids pinging the MPAA's website hasn't been conducive to that image, so in order to better align "DDOS" with "attack," I created a system in which DDOS attacks take place via Nerf gun shooting range using Arduino. Built for Art Hack Day at GAFFTA in San Francisco.
